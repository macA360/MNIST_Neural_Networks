# MNIST_Neural_Networks

This repository contains a series of projects exploring different neural network architectures applied to the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. These projects demonstrate a progression from basic neural networks to more complex Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), showcasing various techniques and approaches in machine learning.

## Projects Overview

### Basic Neural Network for MNIST (mnistTrain.py):
- A simple feedforward neural network implementation.
- Designed to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Features customizable activation functions.

### CNN for MNIST (cnn_mnist.py):
- An implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network.
- Tailored for image recognition tasks with the MNIST dataset.
- Utilizes layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Flatten.
- CNN for Fashion MNIST with Image Augmentation (mnist_fashion_CNN.py):

### A CNN adapted for the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Incorporates ImageDataGenerator for image augmentation.
- Demonstrates the application of CNNs to fashion item recognition.

## Installation and Usage
To run these projects, you need Python and the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, and Scipy. You can install these dependencies using:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy scipy

To execute a script, navigate to the script's directory and run:

python script_name.py

Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to run (e.g., mnistTrain.py).

Alternatively can be run from your chosen IDE.
